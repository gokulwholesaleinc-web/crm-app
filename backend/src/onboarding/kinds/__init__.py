"""DocumentType plugin registry for onboarding document kinds (v3, §B).

A STRATEGY REGISTRY keyed on the packet document's ``kind`` discriminator —
NOT ORM single-table inheritance (which would force a Base remap of the live
``OnboardingPacketDocument`` and risk the running core's dense concurrency
invariants). Each handler owns its author-time validation, fill-time value
coercion, completion required-check, completion artifact production, and scrub.
The lifecycle/security CORE stays kind-agnostic and dispatches through
``KIND_HANDLERS[doc.kind]``.

Load-bearing discipline (§B.1): no code OUTSIDE a handler method may index a
kind-specific key of ``field_definitions`` / ``field_values`` — that is what
dissolves the PDF-baked P0s at the ROOT.

Anti-silent-no-op defense (§B.2): a NON-optional ``Protocol`` (no default no-op
base class) + an IMPORT-TIME presence self-test. A handler missing any member
fails at process start, not in production — killing the "a new kind silently
no-ops a security/completion step" failure class that bred P0-6/P0-8. The
presence check verifies member PRESENCE only (``Protocol``/``runtime_checkable``
cannot verify signature/arity); the kind-parametrized real-PG test matrix is the
real contract guard.
