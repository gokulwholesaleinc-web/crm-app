"""Organic-social ingest (Phase 4) — Graph API insights + pure mapper.

Instagram + Facebook organic metrics share ONE thin REST path against the Meta
Graph ``/{object_id}/insights`` endpoint and ONE pure mapper over the standard
insights envelope (``{"data": [{"name", "period", "values": [{"value", "end_time"}]}]}``),
landing generic ``social_daily_metrics`` rows ``(platform, date, metric_key, value)``.
Reuses the Meta Graph client/seam (token + ``appsecret_proof``) — IG/FB organic is
the same API surface as Meta Ads, so no new network client (DRY).

TikTok/LinkedIn are enum-valid but unwired (App-Review-gated human work); no
handler exists for them, so they can't sync.

The exact metric names + day-boundary attribution are deploy-time tie-out details
(Graph version + App Review gate); this whole feature ships dark behind
``MKTG_SOCIAL_ENABLED``. The mapper is generic over whatever metric names the API
returns, so a metric rename doesn't break the shape — only a renamed/absent
``data`` envelope does (→ ``UnmappableShapeError`` → ``partial``, CRITICAL-1).
